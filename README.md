Command-line editor for Unix like systems.
This is a user-friendly command-line text editor for Linux/Raspbian/Cygwin and most Unix's, written in C.
Made because I detest Vi, and I didn't like any of the alternatives (Emacs, etc).
You will need to compile this yourself, using the scripts supplied.
In the past, this could be compiled for use in a Windows DOS/command box, but it is doubtful that this could happen again.
And with so many excellent Windows text editors available, what would be the point?
